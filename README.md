# Static Site for Midas

This is a static website for the Midas project. It's hosted on [18F Pages](https://github.com/18F/pages/). To change this site or add new pages, commit to the `18f-pages` branch. 

The root page automatically pulls in and displays the main README file in the `devel` branch, since that's the default branch. To make changes to that, just make changes to the README file.
