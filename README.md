# Static Site for OpenOpps Platform

This is a static website for the OpenOpps Platform project. It's hosted on [18F Pages][pages]. To
change this site or add new pages, commit to the `18f-pages` branch.

The root page automatically pulls in and displays the main README file in the `dev` branch, since
that's the default branch. To make changes to that, just make changes to the README file.
